/* 
-> Always remember, database is physically present usually in a different continent. Thus, it takes time for the data to reach us from the database. 
That's why it is absolutely important to use " async and await " while writing the DB connection code.

-> Also, there can be some conflicts while fetching data from the database. 
That's why it is absolutely important to use the " try and catch " block while attempting to connect to the DB.
